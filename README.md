## This fork is for Android

On my Android it takes a while to load.  
You will not have fun if you don't read the *instructions below*  
Refresh the game the first time or it *won't work*.  
Be in landscape mode *before* clicking Run.  
[Run](https://bacionejs.github.io/rob/mobile.html)  



#### Instructions
- on the start screen, tap to start. when the elevator appears you should see yourself walking into the wall
- now, tap where you want the center of your *joystick*. but don't click on the heart/health.
- there is no visual indicator of where the joystick is
- just find a comfortable spot where your right thumb will naturally land
- you must always start a swipe from that point
- if you get excited you will be tempted to start wide and do a long swipe to turn and run from the monster. that won't work. just calmly rotate, then run.
- **right/left/back** are not supported, so you can't run backwards. you must rotate first.
- it is cumbersome looking at the door numbers, so memorize the layout
- remember the room you went in, so when you come out, you know where to go next.
- if your hands are shaking because the monster is on your tail, you will probably choke and get stuck repeatedly opening and closing a door
- tap-tap opens door. now move into the **doorway**. tap-tap to close behind you. it takes practice.

#### Controls
- joystick to rotate (swipe)
- tap to move/stop
- tap     upper-right to pickup stuff
- tap-tap upper-right for door
- tap-tap upper-left for flashlight
