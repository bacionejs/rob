# This fork is for Android

Run

# Instructions
- on the start screen tap-tap on the screen where you want the center of your *joystick*
- but take into account that afterwards when the game goes fullscreen, your joystick will move up
- for example mine moves up 1 inch, so i place it 1 inch lower
- there is no visual indicator of where the joystick is
- just find a comfortable spot where your right thumb will naturally land
- you must always start a swipe from that point
- if you get excited you will be tempted to start wide and do a long swipe to turn and run from the monster. that won't work.
- **right/left/back** are not supported, so you can't run backwards. you must rotate first.
- it is cumbersome looking at the door numbers, so memorize the layout
- remember the room you went in, so when you come out, you know where to go next.
- if your hands are shaking because the monster is on your tail, you will probably choke and get stuck repeatedly opening and closing a door
- tap-tap opens door. now move into the **doorway**. tap-tap to close behind you. it takes practice.

# Controls
- swipe to rotate
- tap to move/stop
- tap     upper-right to pickup stuff
- tap-tap upper-right for door
- tap-tap upper-left for flashlight
